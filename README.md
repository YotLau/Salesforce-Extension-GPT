## üîí Security & Privacy

- Your OpenAI API key is stored locally in Chrome's secure storage
- No data is sent to any server except OpenAI (for generating explanations)
- The extension uses your existing authenticated Salesforce session
- Field obfuscation replaces actual field names with generic placeholders before sending to OpenAI
- You can customize which types of fields are protected
- Only the minimum necessary metadata is extracted for analysis

## üß© Architecture

The extension has been refactored with a modular architecture:
- **Centralized Configuration**: API keys and models managed in a dedicated module
- **Improved Error Handling**: Consistent error handling across all components
- **Generic Component Explainer**: Unified approach to explaining different Salesforce components
- **Enhanced Prompts**: Better structured prompts for more accurate and useful explanations
- **Security Utilities**: Comprehensive field protection with customizable settings

## üó∫Ô∏è Roadmap

Upcoming features in development:

- **Field Mapping Visualization** üîÑ  
  - show a field mapping and type of all fields in the component

- **Flow Test Case Generator** ‚ö°  
  - Auto-generate test scenarios based on flow logic
  - Create data templates for flow testing
  - Export test cases to Salesforce DX format
